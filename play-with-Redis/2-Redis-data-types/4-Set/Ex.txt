- A Set in Redis is an unordered collection of distinct Strings
- it's not possible to add repeated elements to a Set.
- Internally, a Set is implemented as a hash table, 
  which is the reason that some operations are optimized: member addition, removal, and lookup run in O(1), 
  constant time.

- The maximum number of elements that a Set can hold is 232-1  


Some use cases for Sets are:

- Data filtering: For example, filtering all flights that depart from a given city and arrive in another
- Data grouping: Grouping all users who viewed similar products (for example, recommendations on Amazon.com)
- Membership checking: Checking whether a user is on a blacklist
